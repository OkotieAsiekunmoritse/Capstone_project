# Capstone_project

This project aims to deploy a highly sophisticated car rental platform by employing Kubernetes as the orchestration framework. The platform will adopt a decoupled architecture, with Node.js serving as the backend technology and React as the frontend. The utilization of Kubernetes will enable the application to achieve exceptional scalability, maintainability, and resilience.

Users of the platform will benefit from a comprehensive range of features, including the ability to browse, add, and remove cars from the rental inventory, schedule, and book test drives, as well as manage their existing bookings seamlessly. 

Project Overview 

To accomplish this, the project will heavily rely on Amazon Web Services (AWS) as the primary service provider, making use of various pertinent services and cutting-edge technologies offered by AWS. This selection allows for optimal utilization of resources and cost-efficiency, ensuring a streamlined and reliable deployment.

Overall, this project aims to deliver a technologically advanced car rental platform that harnesses the power of Kubernetes, leverages the benefits of AWS services, implements industry-standard practices, and prioritizes security. By doing so, it provides an optimized, scalable, and user-friendly solution for the car rental industry.


CI/CD : 
The implementation plan incorporates continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) processes using Argo CD. By using Argo CD for the  CI/CD in this application, we can automate build, test, and deploy processes, ensure code quality, improve collaboration, and achieve faster and more reliable software releases. Argo CD's flexibility, scalability, and extensive plugin ecosystem make it a powerful tool for streamlining the development and deployment of the application. 

Infrastructure as code (IaC):
To ensure the consistency and manageability of the infrastructure, infrastructure as code (IaC) principles will be followed using Terraform. This will enable the provisioning and configuration of cloud resources in an automated and reproducible manner, promoting better maintainability and reducing the chances of human error.
